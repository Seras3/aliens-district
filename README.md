# aliens-district
ðŸ‘½ Another REACT project. ðŸ‘½
This time you can flex with your collection of aliens.

## Project requirements: 
- Public and Private routes &#10004;
    - As a guest user you're not able to create a post (on */new-post* route) or to edit someone's else post. 
<br/>


- Reusable Components &#10004;
    - Some notable components would be **Responsive Infinite Scroller**, **Page Wrapper** and **Card Component**.
<br/>

- Register, Login, Profile page &#10004;
    - All above and also I created a custom hook that reflect auth state in Redux Store.
    - You can also Register/Login via Google.
<br/>

- State Manager &#10004;
    - I used RTK(Redux Toolkit) because I always wanted to try this "new way" of redux.  
<br/>

- Self developed API or Firebase Backend &#10004;
    - All DB actions use Firestore.
<br/>

**BONUS:** I integrated webpack in order to hot reload Redux Store changes (saving dev time)
